## Author’s Note

This work is presented as an exploratory hypothesis rather than a definitive theory.  
Its purpose is to stimulate discussion, highlight possible connections, and propose falsifiable ideas regarding the nature of dark matter and dark energy.  

The framework is speculative, and many details remain to be developed, particularly at the mathematical and simulation level. Nevertheless, we believe it offers an original perspective inspired by Dirac’s vacuum concept, with predictions that can, in principle, be tested against observations.  

We welcome constructive criticism, collaboration, and feedback to improve and refine the model.
