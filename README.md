Author’s Note (revised)

This work originated from the hypothesis that a nonlocal “vacuum echo” could fully account for flat galactic rotation curves. Our simulations demonstrated that this expectation was overstated: the linear response contributes only ≈10–20% to circular velocities, insufficient to replace dark halos. However, rather than discarding the framework, we recognized its value as a subdominant effective component. By extending the susceptibility to a visco-elastic, causal form χ(ω,k), we uncovered a new and falsifiable signature: resonant bar braking when Ωₚτ ≈ 1 and L_bar ≈ ξ. We consider this shift of focus—from “alternative to halos” to “effective correction with predictive power”—as the true contribution of this paper. It turns a negative result into a constructive path for testing the vacuum’s role in galactic dynamics.
